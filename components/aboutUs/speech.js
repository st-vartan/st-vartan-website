                But the height of the rim on the 35th street side has always
                been 11 feet and the height of the of the 36 street side has
                always been 10 1/2. And the out of bounds has always been the
                poles

                “The regulars like us “ use that to our advantage to beat any
                non regular that come to the courts . It is our rules , just
                like every court in New York City has their rules
              </p>
              <p>
                So maybe we should just leave it how it is , I know some of you
                go play elsewhere and it’s not the same. That’s why this our
                court with our rules and maybe we should keep it that way . If
                you can shoot on a 11 double foot rim than you can shoot
                anywhere. What I would say is just leave it how it is , because
                you guys are use to it already . Just protect the court when you
                see an unfamiliar face , more importantly an unfamiliar 5 , and
                just win .
